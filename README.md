## 2048 in Assembly Language

This is the famous game <a href="https://play2048.co/" target="_blank">2048</a> implemented in Turbo Assembler (TASM). Code is in Spanish - my bad about that - since I did it as a university project in Costa Rica; I mean, why else would anybody implement 2048 in assembly language lol

## Installation

In order to play the game you need to download <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1" target="_blank">DOSBOX</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lsr8WZgvhrT73laZYukScWrJHrhhkJNp/view?usp=sharing">Turbo Assembly (TASM)</a>. For TASM just download the ZIP and extract it wherever you prefer. 

*FYI, you can also find TASM and TLINK online in case you don't download from here :)*

Now you may clone the repo or simply download the 2048.asm file, and place that file in the same folder as the TASM executables - putting the source code file in the same directory is not necessary but it will make this installation more straightforward. 

Once that is done, you may open DOSBOX and mount your drive. For example, if you're using Windows and your TASM folder is in C:/TASM, then you would run the following commands:

```mount d C:/TASM```

Then navigate to the newly mounted D drive:

```d:```

Now you need to assemble the code:

```TASM 2048.asm```

Then link it:

```TLINK 2048.obj```

And finally you may play by just running:

```2048```

It should look like this:

You will probably not do all this, but if you do, have fun!
